The data for each election is in the *.db file named for that year.
Each file is an SQLite database file with three tables:

ridings:
(riding_id INTEGER, name TEXT)

Notes:
- riding_id is the electoral district number provided by Elections Canada

candidates:
(cand_id INTEGER, riding_id INTEGER, name TEXT, party TEXT)

Notes:
- cand_id is not provided by the data files and is generated in the loading code
- riding_id is a reference to a row in the table ridings
- party is a "party code", as given in common_defs.py. Examples: LIB, CON, OTH, etc.

poll_divisions:
(div_id TEXT, riding_id INTEGER, name TEXT)

Notes:
- div_id is text, not an integer. This is because poll numbers can be of the form 21A, etc.
- riding_id is a reference to a row in the table ridings

Results:
In addition to the given columns, the ridings and poll_divisions tables have additional columns to specify results for each candidate.
These are in the form:
(cand<i>_id INTEGER, cand<i>_result INTEGER)
for 0 <= i <= 11.
cand<i>_id is a reference to a row in the table candidates, and cand<i>_result is the number of votes for that poll or riding.

Example:
For a riding with 4 candidates, the result columns would be:
cand0_id, cand0_result, cand1_id, cand1_result ... cand3_id, cand3_result

Most ridings have less than 12 candidates.
In the case where there is no candidate with that number, both columns are empty.
